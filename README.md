# Learning SQL

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to notes and exercises from the Udemy course "SQL para Análise de Dados: Do básico ao avançado". Although my primary focus is not data analysis at the moment, I found the content of this course incredibly useful and applicable to various SQL-related tasks. 

## Course Information
*Course Title:* SQL para Análise de Dados: Do básico ao avançado  
*Platform:* Udemy  
*Instructor:* Midori Toyota  
*DBMS*: PostgreSQL

## Contents
- *Setup*: The initial query used for configuring the PostgreSQL DB.
- *Exercises:* Solutions to the challenges proposed by the instructor at the end of each session.
- *Final Project:* A detailed implementation of the final project from the course.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to document my learning journey through the course and to share the solutions to the exercises and final project. This is intended to be a resource for others who are also learning SQL, even if their focus is not specifically on data analysis.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- *Exercises/:* Contains SQL or MD files with solutions to the challenges from each session.
- *FinalProject/:* Contains the implementation of the final project. It's not implemented yet.

## Disclaimer
I am currently a backend web developer with a focus on Java, and my main interest is in improving my SQL skills. While data analysis is not my primary focus, I believe this course offers valuable insights and practical knowledge that are broadly applicable. Besides, altough most of the repository documentation is in english, the exercises themselves are in portuguese.
